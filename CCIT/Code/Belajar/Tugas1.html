        <h2><i>What's Badminton ?</i></h2>
        <p>
            Badminton is a racket sport played by either two opposing players (singles) or two opposing pairs (doubles), who take positions on opposite halves of a rectangular court that is divided by a net. Players score points by striking a shuttlecock with their racket so that it passes over the net and lands in their opponents' half of the court. A rally ends once the shuttlecock has struck the ground, and the shuttlecock may only be struck once by each side before it passes over the net.
        </p>
        <p>
            The shuttlecock (or shuttle) is a feathered projectile whose unique aerodynamic properties cause it to fly differently from the balls used in most racket sports; in particular, the feathers create much higher drag, causing the shuttlecock to decelerate more rapidly than a ball. Shuttlecocks have a much higher top speed, when compared to other racket sports. As the shuttlecock flight is stubbornly affected by wind, competitive badminton is always played indoors. Badminton is also played outdoors as a casual recreational activity, often as a garden or beach game.

        <h2><i>Badminton History</i></h2>
        <p>
            Badminton's origins can be traced back to ancient civilizations, where shuttlecock games were played in various forms in Greece, China, and India. However, the modern version of the sport emerged in British India during the mid-19th century. British military officers stationed in India encountered a traditional game known as "Poona" and brought it back to England, where it quickly gained popularity among the upper class. The game was named "badminton" after the Duke of Beaufort's Badminton House in Gloucestershire, where it was played extensively. The first set of standardized rules was published in 1873, and the Bath Badminton Club was formed in 1877 to promote the sport.
        </p>
        <p>
            The sport's popularity continued to grow, leading to the establishment of the Badminton Association of England in 1893, which organized the first All England Open Badminton Championships in 1899, the world's oldest badminton tournament. Badminton became an Olympic sport at the 1992 Barcelona Games, solidifying its status on the international stage. Today, it is governed by the 
            <span style="color: rgb(177, 7, 7); font-weight: bold;">Badminton World Federation (BWF)</span>,
            established in 1934, which oversees international competitions and promotes the sport globally. Badminton's fast-paced, dynamic nature has made it a favorite in many countries, particularly in Asia and Europe, where nations like China, Indonesia, South Korea, and Denmark have produced many of the world's top players.

        <h2><i>Tools</i></h2>
        <p>
            There are several tools that we need to play badminton, such as :
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <h4>Racket</h4>
                    <img src="racket.jpg" alt="Racket Photo" width="30%">
                    <p>
                        In badminton, a racket is a lightweight implement used by players to hit the shuttlecock back and forth across the net. A badminton racket typically consists of a handle (or grip), a shaft, a throat, and a head. The head contains a stringed area, which is the part that makes contact with the shuttlecock. Modern badminton rackets are made from materials like carbon fiber or graphite composites, which provide a combination of strength, durability, and light weight, allowing for quick, precise movements and powerful shots.
                        There are also some component that is related to racket, and the most general components are grip and string.

                        <summary>Grip</summary>
                        <p>
                            The grip of a badminton racket is the part that players hold onto during play, and it significantly influences control, comfort, and overall performance. The grip consists of the handle, which is wrapped with a specific material to enhance grip and absorb sweat. There are generally two types of grips used in badminton: the replacement grip and the overgrip. There are 2 types of grip, such as :
                            <ul>
                                <li>
                                    <h4><u>Replacement Grip</u></h4>
                                    <p>
                                        This is the original grip that comes with the racket or a similar type that can be used to replace it. Replacement grips are thicker and provide cushioning, which enhances comfort. They are typically made from materials such as synthetic or natural leather, polyurethane, or other composites that offer a tacky feel, ensuring the racket doesn't slip during play.
                                    </p>
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <h4><u>Overgrip</u></h4>
                                    <p>
                                        This is a thinner grip that is wrapped over the existing grip to provide additional tackiness, absorbency, and control. Overgrips are often used by players who want to slightly increase the grip size without the bulkiness of a replacement grip. They are also easy to replace when worn out, ensuring the racket maintains good grip and hygiene.
                                    </p>
                                </li>
                            </ul>
                            Proper grip technique is crucial in badminton. Players use different types of grips, such as the forehand grip and the backhand grip, depending on the shot they need to execute. Mastery of grip techniques allows for better control, power, and precision, enabling players to perform a wide range of shots effectively. Regular maintenance and replacement of grips help in maintaining optimal performance and comfort.

                        A shuttlecock, also known simply as a shuttle, is the projectile used in the game of badminton. It is designed to be aerodynamically stable, ensuring it flies predictably through the air.
                        The shuttlecock is designed to be lightweight, usually weighing between 4.74 and 5.50 grams. Its unique structure allows it to decelerate rapidly after being hit, which contrasts with other sports projectiles like balls. This property gives badminton its distinct playing style, characterized by quick reflexes and precise control.

                    <p>
                        The Badminton Net is the central gameplay element in a game of Badminton, requiring players to return the shuttlecock from one side of the court to the other during the match. Made taut by the use of weighted tension poles on the outside edges of the badminton court, the badminton net is allowed to sag slightly in the center of the span. Unlike other sport nets that require the poles to be installed permanently, badminton nets are often mobile and can be moved and setup quickly when ready for play. Variations of badminton nets come in polyethylene, nylon, and vinyl.
                        In badminton, the net is a crucial element that divides the court into two equal halves, over which players must hit the shuttlecock. Here are the key features and specifications of a badminton net:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <h4><u>Material</u></h4>
                            <p>
                                The net is typically made of fine, dark-colored cord or nylon mesh, which ensures durability and visibility. The mesh must be uniform and fine enough to prevent the shuttlecock from passing through.
                            </p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <h4><u>Dimensions</u></h4>
                            <p>
                                The standard width of a badminton net is 6.1 meters (20 feet), and the height at the edges (posts) is 1.55 meters (5 feet 1 inch), while the height at the center is 1.524 meters (5 feet). This slightly sagging shape ensures that the net is taut and evenly distributed across the court.
                            </p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <h4><u>Top Band</u></h4>
                            <p>
                                The top of the net is edged with a white tape or binding, usually around 75 mm (3 inches) in depth. This band is doubled over a cord or cable that runs through the length of the net, helping to keep it taut and straight.
                            </p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <h4><u>Posts</u></h4>
                            <p>
                                The net is supported by posts placed on either side of the court, which are positioned over the doubles sidelines, regardless of whether singles or doubles is being played. The posts must be 1.55 meters high and should not extend into the court beyond the sidelines.
                            </p>
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        The net's design ensures that it creates a clear barrier which players must hit the shuttlecock over, making it an integral part of the game's challenge and strategy. Proper installation and maintenance of the net are essential for fair play and the overall quality of the game.
                    </p>
